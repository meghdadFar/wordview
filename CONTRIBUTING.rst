Contributing to wordview
========================

Thank you for contributing to Wordview! We and the users of this repo
appreciate your efforts! Please follow the guidelines below to start contributing to Wordview.

Start with a GitHub Issue
-------------------------
If you are developing a feature, or you spot a problem, or you want to suggest an improvement,
please first search the issues to see whether a related issue already exists.
You can search for the existing issues `here <https://github.com/meghdadFar/wordview/issues>`__.
If a related issue already exists, you can add comment and assign it to yourself,
otherwise, you are welcome to create a new issue.


Get the Up to Date Code
-----------------------
To begin contributing, clone the repository and make sure you are on ``main`` branch,
or if you have already cloned the repo, make sure you have the latest updates.


.. code:: bash

   # Clone the repo
   git clone git@github.com:meghdadFar/wordview.git

   # If it's been a while since you cloned, make sure you have the latest updates:
   git pull

You can now start working on your issue by creating a new branch.

.. code:: bash

   # Create a new branch
   git checkout -b <branch_name>

Please follow these guidelines for naming your branches:

**Use Descriptive Names:** Branch names should provide a clear indication of the purpose or content of the branch. A developer should be able to understand the purpose of the branch just from its name.

**Use Hyphens:** Stick to hyphens ("-") to separate words in branch names. Avoid spaces or special characters that might cause issues on different systems or in URLs.

**Use Lowercase:** Use lowercase letters when naming your branch.

**Include a Prefix**: Use one of the following prefixes:

- feature/ for feature branches
- bugfix/ for bug fix branches
- hotfix/ for critical hotfix branches
- release/ for release branches
- chore/ for maintenance or housekeeping tasks

Here aer some examples:

- feature/user-profile
- bugfix/payment-gateway
- hotfix/security-update
- release/2.1.0
- chore/update-dependencies

Setup your Dev Environment
--------------------------
We use `Poetry <https://pypi.org/project/poetry/>`__ to manage
dependencies and packaging. Follow these steps to set up your dev
environment:

.. code:: bash

   python -m venv .venv

   source .venv/bin/activate

   pip install poetry

   # Disable Poetry's environment creation, since we already have created one
   poetry config virtualenvs.create false

Use Poetry to install dev (and main) dependencies and download NLTK data:

.. code:: bash

   poetry install
   poetry run nltk_download_script

By default, dependencies across all non-optional groups are install. See
`Poetry
documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-dependencies/>`__
for more details and for instructions on how to define optional
dependency groups.

Testing
-------

Testing of ``wordview``\ ‚Äôs is carried out via
`Pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/>`__. Please include tests for any
piece of code that you create inside the `tests <./tests/>`__ directory.
To see examples, you can consult the existing tests in this directory.
Once you have provided the tests, simply run in the command line.

.. code:: bash

   python -m pytest tests

If all tests pass, you can continue with the next steps.

Code Quality
------------
To ensure a high quality in terms of readability, complying with PEP
standards, and static type checking, we use ``pre-commit`` with
``black``, ``flake8``, ``mypy`` and ``isort``. The configurations are in
``.pre-commit-config.yaml``. Once you have installed dev dependencies,
following the above instructions, run ``pre-commit install`` so that the
above tools are installed.

When ``pre-commit`` install its dependencies successfully, it runs
``black``, ``flake8``, ``mypy`` and ``isort`` each time you try to
commit code. If one of these tools fail, fix the issue, run
``git add <changed_file>`` again, and then again
``git commit -m <commit_message>``. Once you successfully committed your
changes, you can push your branch to remote and create a PR. You can now merge your PR, following
the instructions in `Pull Request (PR) <#pull-request-pr>`__. Note that you can
skip pre-commit checks by running your ``git commit`` with the ``--no-verify`` flag (e.g. ``git commit -m 'dirty fix' --no-verify``), however,
this is discouraged unless you really have to. 


Building the Documentation
----------------------------
We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__ to build the documentation.

When you create new functions, write new docstring, or change the existing one, or in general change the documentation, you need to build the documentation again. To do so, run the following command:


.. code:: bash

   sphinx-build -b html sphinx-docs/source docs/

Also, ensure that the file `.nojekyll` always  exists in the docs directory otherwise, the docs will not render correctly on GitHub Pages.

This will build the documentation in the `docs <docs/>`__ directory. You can now commit and push your changes to remote.


Pull Request (PR)
-----------------
Once your work is complete, you can make a pull request. Remember to
link your pull request to an issue by using a supported keyword in the
pull request‚Äôs description or in a commit message. E.g. ‚Äúcloses
#issue_number‚Äù, ‚Äúresolves <#issue_number>‚Äù, or ‚Äúfixes <#issue_number>‚Äù. See
`this
page <https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue>`__
for more details.

A good PR should have the following qualities:

- The title of the PR should be self-explanatory. For instance: "Add knn to clustering algorithms".
- The description of the PR should describe why this PR was created and what was changed.
- An ideal PR is as small as possible. Small PRs can be reviewed and merged quickly, and reduce the risk of bugs. Ideally, a PR should be between 200 to 400 lines of code.

Once your PR is submitted, a maintainer will review your PR. They may
ask questions or suggest changes either using `suggested
changes <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request>`__
or pull request comments.

Once all the comments and changes are resolved, your PR will be merged.
